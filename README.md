# 30daysofcode_hackerrank
###### I am trying to challenge 30 days of code on Hackerrank. It's pretty fun with different problem sets for everyday. I will only upload some interesting problems and solutions (well, at least I think it's interesting;) ). The pace of solving the problems could be fast and slow depending on my priority works. However, just do it!
